# Themes

You can create themes to customize your documentation colors in a very easy way.

A theme is a CSS file stored inside `themes` folder.

To add new theme, copy the `themes/default` folder to `themes\mytheme` then starts editing your theme.
To activate your new theme, edit the `config.php` file and change `'theme' => 'default',` to `'theme' => 'mytheme',`
